# Chess 🚀

A Chinese chess program based on tkintertools and written in Python 3.12 and C++ 20.

![](./preview.png)

This program is implemented using a mix of `tkinter` and `tkintertools` modules, [`tkintertools`](https://github.com/Xiaokang2022/tkintertools) is a third-party Python module that I developed on my own to beautify `tkinter` and provide some advanced features! 🎉

> [!NOTE]  
> Since the original program was written by me one year ago, the `tkintertools` module uses the test version, and the AI of the program was added later, and the previous code quality is relatively poor, please understand. 😅

## How to use

### Before use

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure your Python version is **3.12** or greater and C++ version is **20** or greater.

### Choose the mode

run the `main.py` and choose a game mode you want.

I've provided **4** modes, Three of them can be selected in "新游戏"，and "残局挑战" needs to be selected in the "棋局库".

### One last step

have fun! 😁

## Brief introduction

### Base Features

1. Two-player match
2. Man-machine battles
3. Endgame Challenge
4. LAN connection

### About the AI

I've provided **2** AI algorithms, one of which also provides an implementation of C++20:

1. **Minimum-Max search algorithm**
    - Python: min_max_search.py
2. **Alpha-beta pruning algorithm**
    - Python: alpha_beta_search.py
    - C++ (default):
        * src: ./cpp/HelloWorld.cpp
        * dll: ./PyDLL.dll

You can change them in the settings. By the way, default value of the search depth is 4.

> [!TIP]  
> Due to the smaller number of pieces in endgame mode, the search space is smaller, and you can increase the AI's search depth a little more, and the results could be even better!

> [!CAUTION]  
> You can also modify the pieces of the individual AI algorithms to evaluate the scores if you want, but be careful not to set the score to a limit value (like `math.inf`), which will cause the algorithm to not come up with the correct result!

### Some really great features

When you're playing chess, the terminal actually has an output! For example:

<font color="yellow">SCORE</font>: 2  
<font color="royalblue">STEP</font>: 5  
〇〇<font color="green">象士将士象马车  
车</font>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇  
〇<font color="green">炮马</font>〇〇〇〇<font color="green">炮</font>〇  
<font color="green">卒</font>〇<font color="green">卒</font>〇<font color="green">卒</font>〇<font color="green">卒</font>〇<font color="green">卒</font>  
〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇  
〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇  
<font color="red">兵</font>〇<font color="red">兵</font>〇<font color="red">兵</font>〇<font color="red">兵</font>〇<font color="red">兵</font>  
〇〇<font color="red">馬</font>〇<font color="red">砲</font>〇〇<font color="red">砲</font>〇  
〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇  
〇<font color="red">車相仕帥仕相馬車</font>  

It provides a very clear picture of the game state and the current AI score.
